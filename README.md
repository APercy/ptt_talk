This only works with minetest 5.5

This mod is divided into two parts.
The first part, in lua, runs on the server, creates a port to receive files from users, in case, ogg files
The second is a C++ program to record the voice and send to minetest. You start the recording hiting ALT key.
To stop the record just type ALT again., The record will stop automatically at 10 seconds.

Then when the server receives the audio file, it will play it

have fun
